intro: Craftwork is setting out to revolutionize the general contracting industry. They work with homeowners, frustrated by the manual, unpredictable, and outdated processes involved in completing any home project. With Craftwork, you can use technology to simplify the experience and deliver consistently high-quality project work. We worked with their team to establish a brand strategy, visual identity, and new marketing website. <p>Collaborators&#x3a; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.itslaurenjones.com/">Lauren Jones</a> (Photography)</p>

    <p>Through our brand workshops and conversations, we agreed that the uConnect identity needed a modern and fresh update. But at the same time, we needed to create a broader range of style and visual expression.</p>
    <p>We aligned on the attributes of essential, approachable, and radical. And these guardrails helped us create a solid foundation of language for uConnect, as well as served as the springboard for the visual identity.</p>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The identity for uConnect celebrates the joy of finding one's career. The broad range of colors serve as a sign of the diverse landscape that is career exploration. The typography feels smart and studied—but not too serious. And the playful illustration, by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamdesignshop/">Samuel Dickison</a>, bring everything together in a whimsical way.</p>
    <p>For the logo, we cleaned up the mark and made everything more scalable and legible.</p>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
   <p>Part of the uConnect brand strategy involves empowering Career Services professionals. The Career Everywhere movement is all about enabling modern career services professionals to scale the impact of their work by embedding career resources into the classroom, across campus, and beyond.</p>
    <p>We created a sub-brand for this movement that allows other people to join in uConnect's cause. Through the use of a chat bubble visual language, the Career Everywhere sub-brand centered around the idea of having career conversations earlier, and more often.</p>
