intro: Siena is the first-of-its-kind autonomous customer service platform that combines the best of human empathy and intelligent automation to transform how brands engage with customers. The founders of <a href="/project/cartloop">Cartloop</a> co-founded Siena after seeing the opportunity to transform their customers' e-commerce businesses with AI. We worked with them to create a fun and engaging identity that felt new, fresh, and inspired by AI.

    <h3 class="displayLarge">Strategy</h3>
</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>While growing an e-commerce brand, companies often automate much of the business. But along the way, they lose the human touch. They lose a key part of what originally made them successful: a meaningful connection with their customers.</p>
    <p>This sentiment was vital to the foundation of the Cartloop brand strategy. Through our workshop together and subsequent conversations, we uncovered the need to highlight human connection as a key differentiator. To embody this, we hit upon "Be Good to Your Customers," as a rallying cry for both an internal and external focus.</p>

</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The identity for Cartloop leaned more into the Premium, Bold, and Simple brand attributes. The wider logotype established a bold feel, while the tall x-height and single story a make it feel somewhat playful.</p>

    <p>The visual language for Cartloop is where the real personality shines through. We developed a visual language that centered around the chat experience, but used photography and other elements to feel natural, human, and organic.</p>
