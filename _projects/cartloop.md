intro: Cartloop is an ecommerce startup that's changing the way people interact with brands. Instead of automated messages (or chat bots), Cartloop is helping brands grow by creating super-personalized experiences throughout the entire shopping journey. We worked with Cartloop to create a new brand strategy and visual identity. We also created a unique visual language that would scale across various touchpoints like website, illustrations, and social media. <p>Collaborators&#x3a; <a target="_blank" href="https://studiomightymighty.com/">Ryan Harrison</a></p>

    <h3 class="displayLarge">Strategy</h3>
</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>While growing an e-commerce brand, companies often automate much of the business. But along the way, they lose the human touch. They lose a key part of what originally made them successful: a meaningful connection with their customers.</p>
    <p>This sentiment was vital to the foundation of the Cartloop brand strategy. Through our workshop together and subsequent conversations, we uncovered the need to highlight human connection as a key differentiator. To embody this, we hit upon "Be Good to Your Customers," as a rallying cry for both an internal and external focus.</p>

    <h3 class="displayLarge">Identity</h3>
</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The identity for Cartloop leaned more into the Premium, Bold, and Simple brand attributes. The wider logotype established a bold feel, while the tall x-height and single story a make it feel somewhat playful.</p>

    <p>The visual language for Cartloop is where the real personality shines through. We developed a visual language that centered around the chat experience, but used photography and other elements to feel natural, human, and organic.</p>
