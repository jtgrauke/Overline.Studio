intro: Craftwork is setting out to revolutionize the general contracting industry. They work with homeowners, frustrated by the manual, unpredictable, and outdated processes involved in completing any home project. With Craftwork, you can use technology to simplify the experience and deliver consistently high-quality project work. We worked with their team to establish a brand strategy, visual identity, and new marketing website. <p>Collaborators&#x3a; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.itslaurenjones.com/">Lauren Jones</a> (Photography)</p>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>One aspect of the process we all enjoyed was our brand workshop conversations. With Craftwork being a new startup, it was pivotal to spend the time discussing how we wanted Craftwork to be perceived by their target audience.</p>
    <p>We chose the Hero brand archetype, and from there aligned on Honest, Candid, and Brave as powerful descriptors for how the brand should look and feel.</p>

    <h3 class="displayLarge">Identity</h3>
</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The identity for Craftwork is simple, modern, and approachable. Most of the landscape uses bright primary colors, but we opted for a more restrained and muted palette. The bold typography carries our punchy and straightforward message. And the clean photography, by Lauren Jones, bring everything together in a classic way.</p>
