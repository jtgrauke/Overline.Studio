date: 2023-02-25
intro: HKR is a pioneering talent-insourcing team, dedicated to embedding top-tier talent into organizations for a reasonable monthly fee. Their mission is to change the perception of outsourcing. However, they faced a challenge - their brand did not encapsulate this unique value proposition. This was where we stepped in to help HKR craft a compelling brand strategy, identity, and website that truly matched their offering.

    <h3 class="displayLarge">Strategy</h3>
</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>Our strategy started with a series of intensive workshops, aimed at understanding the core of HKR's mission and operations. Through these discussions, we arrived at a powerful and succinct tagline: "Insource your talent, Outsource the headache." This phrase encapsulated the company's unique value proposition and acted as a cornerstone for our subsequent brand work.</p>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>In keeping with HKR's love of simplicity and efficiency, we designed a custom logomark that was as straightforward as it was impactful: "HKR". This bold and minimalist logo became an immediate identifier for the company and its values.</p>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>To bring the brand to life, we developed a vibrant visual language inspired by the concept of DNA - representing the unique blend of qualities each talent brings to a company. This was realized through gradients of teal, orange, magenta, and indigo, forming DNA-inspired patterns. </p>
    <p>The typefaces Piazzolla and Manrope were chosen to complement this energetic palette, creating a harmonious balance between vibrancy and sophistication.</p>
