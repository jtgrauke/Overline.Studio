description: 'ERP Software for Small Businesses'
date: 2023-03-25
intro: For 30+ years, Eagle Business Software has been helping small to medium-sized enterprises manage and grow their businesses. EBS had reached a point where their mission, and focus were not aligned with their brand. We worked with their team to establish a new name, Koble, as well as a brand strategy, visual identity, and website. <p>Collaborators&#x3a; <a target="_blank" href="https://mattyow.com/">Matt Yow</a> (Naming)</p>

    <p>Through our brand workshops and conversations, we uncovered the strong value-based foundation the team had. We wanted to make sure and capture this understanding, and use it as inspiration for the entire process.</p>
    <p>We aligned on the attributes of dependable, optimistic, and best-in-class. These attributes, along with the guiding principles we defined helped to lay a strong foundation for the name, and verbal and visual identity.</p>

</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The identity for Koble has a seamless systematic feel. From the angled pattern, inspired by the mark, to the grounded color palette, there is a sense of maturity and trust associated with the visual identity.</p>
    <p>The mark was nicknamed the "Klick" because of the way the two elements seem to lock together, signifying partnership.</p>

    <p>Change for any company is a challenge, and changing the name of an organization that has as much history as we have is a particularly difficult thing to do. But when we actually announced, first to our employees, and then to our clients, both groups really resonated with the new name and our brand colors. It really showed that you captured the core of who we are, making it a much smoother change than it could have been.”</p>
