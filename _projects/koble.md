description: 'ERP Software for Small Businesses'
date: 2023-03-25
intro: For 30+ years, Eagle Business Software has been helping small to medium-sized enterprises manage and grow their businesses. EBS had reached a point where their mission, and focus were not aligned with their brand. We worked with their team to establish a new name, Koble, as well as a brand strategy, visual identity, and website. <p>Collaborators&#x3a; <a target="_blank" href="https://mattyow.com/">Matt Yow</a> (Naming)</p>

    <p>Through our brand workshops and conversations, we uncovered the strong value-based foundation the team had. We wanted to make sure and capture this understanding, and use it as inspiration for the entire process.</p>
    <p>We aligned on the attributes of dependable, optimistic, and best-in-class. These attributes, along with the guiding principles we defined helped to lay a strong foundation for the name, and verbal and visual identity.</p>

</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The identity for Koble has a seamless systematic feel. From the angled pattern, inspired by the mark, to the grounded color palette, there is a sense of maturity and trust associated with the visual identity.</p>
    <p>The mark was nicknamed the "Klick" because of the way the two elements seem to lock together, signifying partnership.</p>
