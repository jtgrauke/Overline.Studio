    <p>We began with a series of discussions with key team members to identify which of Populi’s attributes were most important. We also began verbalize how Populi helps customers go from where they are to where they want to be.</p>
    <p>It was through these discussions that we landed on a few key alliterative phrases: Focus on teaching, not technology. Focus on the future, not features. Focus on serving, not software.</p>
