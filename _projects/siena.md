</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>The core challenge for Siena was to establish themselves as a best-in-class AI customer service platform that offers a radical and bold solution. In our workshops and brainstorming sessions, we identified the need to emphasize empathy and human connection in their brand strategy. We encapsulated this essence with the tagline, "Humanize The Internet," emphasizing both their innovative approach and customer-centric focus.</p>

</div>

<div class="span-12 md-span-6 md-start-7">
    <p>Siena's brand attributes of Radical, Bold, and Best-In-Class were brought to life through their visual identity. The simple yet bold logotype, based on Ginto, conveys strength and innovation, while the playful and human typography, Ambit, creates a sense of approachability and warmth.</p>
    <p>We developed a vibrant color gradient that includes neon chartreuse, purple, pink, and orange. These eye-catching colors evoke energy and excitement, reinforcing the innovative and bold nature of the brand.</p>
    <p>To add a fun and relatable element to Siena's visual language, we designed a mascot character that lives within their illustrations. This playful character embodies Siena's empathic, almost-human AI, and helps to create an emotional connection with users.</p>
