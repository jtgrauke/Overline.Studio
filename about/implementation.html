                Adopting new software for your college can actually be a pleasant experience. Populi
                strives for it. Our implementation team actively seeks your feedback and input to make sure 
                your data imports accurately and completely. Data migration is as fully secure
                as everything else we do. And we begin training your key users so your college is ready to go
                when the process is completed.

            <h4>
                A quick overview
            </h4>
            <p>
                Our implementation process typically takes two to four months. It&#8217;s pretty simple: you send us your
                data via our secure servers, and we fine-tune a custom-built data migrator until you're satisfied with how
                it works. Meanwhile, you keep using your old system, and on the &#8220;go-live&#8221; date, we import your most
                recent data using the fine-tuned migrator. Our staff actively seeks your input, and we help you make sure
                it all works.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Better data
            </h4>
            <p>
                Our data import process doesn't just put your information in a new tool. It also identifies problems
                in your data and helps to clean and repair it. The end result is a more usable and accessible
                dataset that will do more for your college.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Your data is safe
            </h4>
            <p>
                We treat all of our customers&#8217; data securely. We set up secure FTP sites
                for you to upload your data to our servers. Once it&#8217;s in our hands, the only people with access to it
                are our designated data staff and, of course, you.
            </p>
