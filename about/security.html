            <h3>We designed Populi for security.</h3>
            
            <p class="lead">
                Our technology choices, programming decisions, and development standards all work to keep
                your college&#8217;s information private, safe, and secure.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Secure hardware
            </h4>
            <p>
                Populi&#8217;s servers are stored in an SSAE 16 Type II compliant data center that is
                physically secured behind a battery of compartmentalized security zones with biometric access controls.
                Numerous security, power supply, and infrastructure redundancies layer on additional safeguards.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Daily backups
            </h4>
            <p>
                Security isn&#8217;t just about preventing unauthorized access; Populi also actively protects your data
                against loss. Daily, weekly, and monthly data &#8220;snapshots&#8221; back up all your information in a
                fully-encrypted &#8220;cloud&#8221; in real-time.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Encryption
            </h4>
            <p>    
                Your computers access Populi over 256-bit SSL-encrypted connections. That&#8217;s the same
                technology that secures things like online bank transactions.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Proactive monitoring
            </h4>
            <p>    
                Populi keeps the software and your data behind secure firewalls and actively monitors for
                hacking or probing attempts. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Design standards
            </h4>
            <p>    
                We built Populi on the open-source &#8220;LAMP&#8221; stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), availing you 
                of the same powerful, secure technology undergirding web companies like Google,
                Vimeo, Facebook, and Amazon.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Responsive development
            </h4>
            <p>    
                Keeping a close eye on emerging internet security threats, the Populi team quickly
                updates the program with safeguards and security patches. Security is an ongoing process here,
                and we&#8217;re continually strengthening Populi&#8217;s defenses.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Strong passwords
            </h4>
            <p>    
                Populi requires hacker-resistant, alphanumeric passwords, considered to be one of
                the best defenses against hijacked user accounts&mdash;which are, in turn, the leading
                cause of security breaches.
            </p>
            <h4>
                User access privileges
            </h4>
            <p>    
                Populi&#8217;s user privilege levels and per-item visibility settings ensure that sensitive data is kept
                confidential.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Timed logouts
            </h4>
            <p>    
                The system automatically logs users out after a short period of inactivity. That helps prevent
                unauthorized users from accessing an account on an unattended computer.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Change log
            </h4>
            <p>    
                Populi keeps a detailed change log on important records&mdash;recording
                the change, who performed it, and when.
