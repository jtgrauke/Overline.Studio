                Software should help your college work better. It needs to be easy to use and it should have responsive,
                knowledgeable, and honest customer support behind it. So that&#8217;s how we back you up&mdash;and it&#8217;s
                included in Populi's <a href="/pricing">low monthly price.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting at implementation, we give you full access to the complete array of training and support
                so you&#8217;re ready to go when Populi is. Our goal is to make the experience of adopting new
                software as quick and painless as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your ongoing experience with Populi is just as important to us. If you need help, you&#8217;re never stranded.
                You can always get on our online help desk and find tutorials, training videos, user forums, and submit help requests to
                Populi Customer Support. Or give us a call, Monday through Friday, 6 AM to 5 PM, Pacific Time,
                for more training or run-throughs of new features. We&#8217;ll help you out&mdash;and it
                won&#8217;t cost you a cent.
            </p>

                Populi Customer Support is guided by these principles:
            </p>
            <h4>
                Make it easy to use
            </h4>
            <p>
                Waiting for support takes time and money. So we&#8217;ve built Populi around a great
                user experience so you can just do what you need to get done.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Be responsive
            </h4>
            <p>
                Most of our support requests are resolved in less than 24 hours. You don't have time to wait for help,
                and our success depends on how well we serve you.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Be knowledgeable
            </h4>
            <p>
                Everyone at Populi gets involved with support. Your request might be answered by the guy who built
                the feature you're asking about. Whether it's a quick bugfix or a more detailed training session, you've got all of
                us near at hand to make sure everything's working.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Be honest
            </h4>
            <p>
                What good is support that doesn't tell the truth? If we fall short, we want to know, and we want to make it right.
                We're open about technical issues, server downtime, and unexpected problems. Keep up with us at
                <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/populi">Twitter</a> and our
                <a href="http://support.populiweb.com/">help desk</a>. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Support shouldn&#8217;t cost you
            </h4>
            <p>
                We don't charge for customer support&mdash;or upgrades, or any of the other stuff a lot of companies would
                nickel-and-dime you for. <a href="/pricing">You pay by the student</a>, and get everything we offer.
            </p>
