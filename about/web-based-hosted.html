                Populi is web-based software. You simply use it over the internet with a web browser. You’ll never need to install anything on your computer—no CDs, no downloads, no upgrades. Web-based software is fairly common already, and can handle some pretty complex tasks. Web-based email like Gmail or Hotmail, social apps like Facebook—or even your online banking software—give you an idea of what it’s about.

            <h4>
                No IT worries
            </h4>
            <p>
                Populi relieves you of the technical worries. It&#8217;s hosted, maintained, and backed up 
                on our <a href="/about/security">very secure</a>, off-site servers. We handle the IT stuff&mdash;the software,
                the updates, the technology, the security. You benefit from our economies of scale, and simply run your college.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Safe, secure, backed up
            </h4>
            <p>
                Web-based software is safe&mdash;safer than &#8220;traditional&#8221; software.
                Computers get stolen, are rarely backed up properly, and seldom have the latest security patches and updates.
                But Populi stores your data on our enterprise-class servers, which are backed up
                daily, protected against emerging threats, and located in a world-class, high-security data center.
            </p>
            <h4>
                One central database
            </h4>
            <p>
                Populi keeps all of your data in a centralized location which is accessible over the web.
                Since you can get to it from any computer, this eliminates the &#8220;it&#8217;s on the other computer&#8221; problem.
                With everyone on the same database, all your information stays in one place, with the same level of protection and
                security for every user. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Works on any computer
            </h4>
            <p>
                Populi runs in a web browser, so it works on any computer you&#8217;re likely to have at your
                college&mdash;Mac, Windows, or Linux. Forget about downloads, installations, updates, and all that stuff.
                Just log in and use it. You&#8217;ll always have the newest and best version, without lifting a finger.
