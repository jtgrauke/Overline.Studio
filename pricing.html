                <p><strong>What's a billable student?</strong></p>
                <p>“Billable students” are your full-time, part-time, and auditing students who take at least one course in a calendar month. In other words, your cost scales with your enrollment. See the Terms of Service for more details.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="features-item mb3">
                <p><strong>File storage</strong></p>
                <p>"File storage" includes storage and backup for the files you keep in Populi—documents, spreadsheets, pictures, even audio and video. It also includes encoding, streaming, and bandwidth for your media. You get 2,000 GB of free file storage, with additional storage available for 10¢ per GB per month.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="features-item mb3">
                <p><strong>Text Messages</strong></p>
                <p>You get 5,000 free text messages each month, which count towards one text per individual recipient (U.S. and Canadian carriers only). Additional text messages are available for 2¢ per text recipient.</p>

                <p><strong>No long term commitment</strong></p>
                <p>We don’t lock you down with long-term contracts. Why? It keeps us on our toes. Our business plan is simple: to win all of our customers back every month. And if we don’t win you back, you have no obligation to stay.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="features-item mb3">
                <p><strong>No fees for upgrades or updates</strong></p>
                <p>We handle all the upgrades and updates. We don’t bother you with installation or upgrade fees. You’ll always have the newest, most powerful version available—and our full support behind it. And you’ll never pay a nickel more to get it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="features-item mb3">
                <p><strong>No technology investments</strong></p>
                <p>You don’t need new servers, new staff, or other software for Populi to work. All you need are things you already have: computers, web browsers, and high-speed internet.</p>
